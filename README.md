# Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)

A command-line interface (CLI) Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python. This project demonstrates the use of 2D arrays, functions, and game-loop logic.

## Features
* **Two-Player Mode:** Play locally with a friend (Player X vs Player O).
* **Input Validation:** Prevents players from choosing out-of-bounds coordinates or overwriting existing moves.
* **Win Detection:** Automatically detects horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
* **Tie Detection:** Recognizes when the board is full with no winner.

  #Future Additions
  * Add a fun looking fronted to make it feel more game-like
